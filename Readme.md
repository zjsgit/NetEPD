# NetEPD
NetEPD is a network-based essential protein discovery platform. This resource integrates data on Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks, gene expression, subcellular localization, and a native set of essential proteins. It also computes a variety of node centrality measures, evaluates the predictions of essential proteins, and visualizes PPI networks. This comprehensive platform functions by implementing four activities, which include the collection of datasets, computation of centrality measures, evaluation, and visualization. The results produced by NetEPD are visualized on its website, and sent to a user-provided email, and they are available to download in a parsable format. This platform is freely available at http://bioinformatics.csu.edu.cn/netepd.
